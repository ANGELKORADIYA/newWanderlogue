        <h2>How We Came Up with the Idea</h2>
        <p>
          Our team, consisting of Angel, Tejas, Tushar, Yashrajsing, and me (your name), came together with a shared passion for education and technology.
          We wanted to create a platform that makes learning engaging and fun. Combining our skills in development, design, writing, and AI, we embarked on
          the journey to create this study and quiz app. By brainstorming ideas, conducting research, and iterating on prototypes, we eventually developed
          a product that we believe can make a positive impact on learners of all ages.
